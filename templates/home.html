{{define "body"}}<h1>Unofficial ActivityPub Testsuite</h1>
<p>This server allows you to run a machine-assisted test suite against
an ActivityPub application. It is a port of the old official test suite.
While the old test suite was comprehensive for C2S and S2S, it was mostly
a questionnaire for the S2S portion. This test suite aims to minimize the
"on your honor" questions, though it cannot eliminate all of them.</p>
<p>When you run a test suite, please take notice of the following
considerations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You run tests <u>only</u> against servers you own</li>
	<li>You do <u>not</u> use the testsuite for spam &amp; abuse</li>
	<li>You do <u>not</u> abuse the testsuite server</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, usage of these testsuites <b>is monitored</b>.</p>
<p>If the community cannot be respectful in its usage of this testsuite
then it will no
longer be hosted as a freely available resource.</p>
